                        specific limitations in relation to the goods or
                        services. (i.e. if a Merchant specifies that only one
                        qtekhub.com Voucher maybe purchased by a customer, the
                        customer must abide by same, if the customer goes ahead

                        of same without paying any compensation or refund
                        whatsoever to the customer. In such an instance

                        liabilities and costs suffered by or in respect of a

                        or the merchant, as well as for any unclaimed property
                        liability arising from unredeemed Vouchers. Eatery
                        -Specific Vouchers and Merchant Vouchers are redeemable
                        “as is” only and may not be redeemed incrementally. A
                        qtekhub.com Voucher can only be redeemed at the cash
                        value paid by the customer for it (i.e. if you paid
                        N500.00 for a Qmarthub Voucher, but the voucher gives
                        you N3000.00 of value to the Merchant, the cash value
                        that you paid is N500.00 as opposed to the authentic
                        value/actual value of N3000.00).Please note all
                        expiration dates on Vouchers are valid and therefore
                        govern the last date which you can use the VOUCHER, in
                        the event you do not redeem your voucher before the
                        expiration, you automatically forfeit same, unless the

                        liability at a market rate of exchange for the purpose
                        of set-off. In the event such set-off does not fully
                        reimburse Qmarthub for the amount owed, the Seller shall
                        immediately pay Qmarthub such outstanding amount. The
